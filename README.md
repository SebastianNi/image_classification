# Project: Image Classification
## My 2nd Project in the Deep Learning Foundation Nanodegree Program at [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/)

### Link to the Udacity project repository

https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning/tree/master/image-classification

### Project Overview
In this project, I classified images from the [CIFAR-10 dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html). The dataset consists of airplanes, dogs, cats, and other objects.

### Install

This project requires **Python 3.5** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/)
- [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/)

### Run

In order to run the code in the jupyter notebook you also need the file [**helper.py**](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning/blob/master/image-classification/helper.py) and [**problem_unittests.py**](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning/blob/master/image-classification/problem_unittests.py) from the [Udacity project repository](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning/tree/master/image-classification).

Load the file with jupyter notebook using the following command:

```jupyter notebook dlnd_image_classification.ipynb```
